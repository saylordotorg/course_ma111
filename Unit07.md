**Unit 7: Sets, Part II** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study cardinality.  One startling realization is
that not all infinite sets are the same size.  In fact, there are many
different size infinite sets.  This can be made perfectly understandable
to you at this stage of the course.  In Unit 7.4.3, section* *(d)iii,
you learned about bijections from set A to set B.  If two sets A and B
have a bijection between them, they are said to be equinumerous.  It
turns out that the relation equinumerous is an equivalence relation on
the collection of all subsets of the real numbers (in fact on any set of
sets).  The equivalence classes (the cells) of this relation are called
cardinalities.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 8.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Introduction: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 3.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.3: 1 hour

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Compute the image and inverse image of sets under a given function.
-   Determine if a function has an inverse function, and if so (and when
    possible), determine a formula for it.
-   Establish bijections between certain subsets of real numbers, and
    connect this to computing the cardinality of these sets.
-   Define the Cantor set, and prove that it is uncountable.
-   Recognize countable subsets of the real numbers.
-   Establish properties of countable sets.
