**Unit 6: Relations and Functions** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about binary relations from a set **A** to
a set **B**.  Some of these relations are functions from **A** to **B**.
 Restricting our attention to relations from a set **A** to the set
**A**, this unit discusses the properties of reflexivity(R),
symmetry(S), anti-symmetry(A), and transitivity(T).  Relations that
satisfy R, S, and T are called equivalence relations, and those
satisfying R, A, and T are called partial orderings.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 4.75 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 1.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.4: 2 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Determine if a relation possesses certain properties, including
    reflexivity, symmetry, antisymmetry, and transitivity.
-   Recognize and prove that certain relations are equivalence
    relations.
-   Recognize and prove that certain relations are partial orderings
    and/or total orderings.
-   Recognize when a relation is a function.
-   Determine when a function is one-to one and when it is onto.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch the video. 
    It may be worth spending some time watching this video twice.  Note
    that the lecturer spends some time discussing the definitions of the
    properties below for sub-subunits 6.1.1 through 6.1.5.  The examples
    he provides exhibit several properties.  These are the defining
    properties of an equivalence relation (see subunit 6.4) and Partial
    Ordering (see subunit 6.5).  Note that this resource covers the
    topics outlined for sub-subunits 6.1.1 through 6.1.6.  
      
     Watching this video twice and taking notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.
