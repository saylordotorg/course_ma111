**Unit 8: Combinatorics** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn to count.  That is, you will learn to
classify the objects of a set in such a way that one of several
principles applies.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 11 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.1: 6.5 hours

  
 ☐    Reading: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Lecture 1.5 hours

  
 ☐    Subunit 8.2: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.3: 2 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Distinguish between situations in which sampling with replacement is
    appropriate and those in which sampling without replacement should
    be used as well as the effect each has on the number of outcomes
    arising in various applications
-   Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve a variety of counting
    problems.
-   Use the pigeon-hole principle in various settings.
-   Recognize when a counting problem requires the use combinations,
    permutations, or some other combinatorial object.
