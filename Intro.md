Course Syllabus for "MA111: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this course is to bridge the gap between
introductory mathematics courses in algebra, linear algebra, and
calculus on one hand and advanced courses like mathematical analysis and
abstract algebra, on the other hand, which typically require students to
provide proofs of propositions and theorems.  Another purpose is to pose
interesting problems that require you to learn how to manipulate the
fundamental objects of mathematics: sets, functions, sequences, and
relations.  The topics discussed in this course are the following:
mathematical puzzles, propositional logic, predicate logic, elementary
set theory, elementary number theory, and principles of counting.  The
most important aspect of this course is that you will learn what it
means to prove a mathematical proposition.  We accomplish this by
putting you in an environment with mathematical objects whose structure
is rich enough to have interesting propositions.  The environments we
use are propositions and predicates, finite sets and relations,
integers, fractions and rational numbers, and infinite sets. Each topic
in this course is standard except the first one, puzzles.  There are
several reasons for including puzzles.  First and foremost, a
challenging puzzle can be a microcosm of mathematical development.  A
great puzzle is like a laboratory for proving propositions.  The puzzler
initially feels the tension that comes from not knowing how to start
just as the mathematician feels when first investigating a topic or
trying to solve a problem.  The mathematician “plays”  with the topic or
problem, developing conjectures which he/she then tests in some special
cases. Similarly, the puzzler  “plays” with the puzzle.  Sometimes the
conjectures turn out to be provable, but often they do not, and the
mathematician goes back to playing.  At some stage, the puzzler
(mathematician) develops sufficient sense of the structure and only then
can he begin to build the solution (prove the theorem).  This multi-step
process is perfectly mirrored in solving the KenKen problems this course
presents.  Some aspects of the solutions motivate ideas you will
encounter later in the course.  For example, modular congruence is a
standard topic in number theory, and it is also useful in solving some
KenKen problems. Another reason for including puzzles is to foster
creativity.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:

    predicates and propositions.
-   Solve problems related to place value, divisors, and remainders.
-   Use modular arithmetic to solve various equations, including
    quadratic equations in Z<sub>6</sub>, Z<sub>7</sub>, Z<sub>11</sub>
    and Diophantine equations.
-   Prove and use the salient characteristics of the rational,
    irrational, and real number systems to verify properties of various
    number systems.
-   Use mathematical induction to construct proofs of propositions about
    sets of positive integers.
-   Classify relations as being reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric,
    transitive, a partial ordering, a total ordering, or an equivalence
    relation.
-   Determine if a relation is a function, and if so, whether or not it
    is a bijection.
-   Manipulate finite and infinite sets by using functions and set
    operations.
-   Determine if a set is finite, countable, or uncountable.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA111: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning!  Below, please
find some general information on the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Harold B.
Reiter](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorHaroldBReiter)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:  

-   YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ National Programme
    on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL): Dr. Kamala Krithivasan’s
    Lectures
-   Old Dominion University: Shunichi Toida’s Discrete Mathematics Web
    Course Material

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.  Pay
special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Subunit 1.2 Activity
-   Subunit 1.3 Activity
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.1 Activity
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.2 Activity
-   Unit 1 Assessments
-   Sub-subunit 3.4.5.1 Activity
-   Sub-subunit 3.4.5.2 Activity
-   Sub-subunit 3.7.1 Activity
-   The Final Exam 

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments and assessment listed above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **112.25
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take approximately 31.5 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 4 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2,
which is optional (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 1.3
and 1.4 (a total of 4.25 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.
