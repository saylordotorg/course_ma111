**Unit 4: Rational Numbers** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn to prove some basic properties of rational
numbers.  For example, the set of rational numbers is dense in the set
of real numbers.  That means that strictly between any two real numbers,
you can always find a rational number.  The distinction between a
fraction and a rational number will also be discussed.  There is an easy
way to tell whether a number given in decimal form is rational: if the
digits of the representation regularly repeat in blocks, then the number
is rational.  If this is the case, you can find a pair of integers whose
quotient is the given decimal.  The unit discusses the mediant of a pair
of rational fractions, and why the mediant does not depend on the values
of its components, but instead on the way they are represented.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this
    article.  Pay special attention to the five problems on rational
    numbers at the beginning of the paper.  Problem 10 will enable you
    to appreciate the different between the value of a number and the
    numeral used to express it.  Pay special attention to Simpson’s
    Paradox in the paper.  Try the practice problems at the end of the
    reading.  After you have attempted these problems, please check the
    solutions against the Saylor Foundation’s [“Fractions
    Solutions”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MA111_Fractions-Solutions.pdf)

**4.2.3 Density of Rational Numbers** <span id="4.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below the Unit 4
introduction.  An interesting property of the rational numbers is that
between any two rational numbers we insert another rational number.
 This property is called density.  We say the rational numbers are dense
in the real numbers.  The same property holds for irrational numbers.
 Try proving these propositions.  Problem 6 in the essay discusses this
property.*  
    
 *This topic is also covered in the reading assigned below subunit
4.3.2.  In particular, focus on Section 6, “Density of Rational
Numbers.”*
