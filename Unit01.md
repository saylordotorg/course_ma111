**Unit 1: Logic** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will begin by considering various puzzles, including
Ken-Ken and Sudoku.  You will learn the importance of tenacity in
approaching mathematical problems including puzzles and brain teasers.
 You will also learn why giving names to mathematical ideas will enable
you to think more effectively about concepts that are built upon several
ideas.  Then, you will learn that propositions are (English) sentences
whose truth value can be established.  You will see examples of
self-referencing sentences which are not propositions.  You will learn
how to combine propositions to build compound ones and then how to
determine the truth value of a compound proposition in terms of its
component propositions.  Then, you will learn about predicates, which
are functions from a collection of objects to a collection of
propositions, and how to quantify predicates.  Finally, you will study
several methods of proof including proof by contradiction, proof by
complete enumeration, etc.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Determine the truth value of a proposition.
-   Use truth tables to verify the logical equivalence of two
    mathematical expressions, statements, and propositions, as well as
    to determine the category of a proposition: tautology, contingency,
    or contradiction.
-   Form the negation, contrapositive, converse, and inverse of a
    proposition.
-   Express statements formally using universal quantifiers, logical
    connectives, and predicates.
-   Use the technique “proof by contradiction” to verify a mathematical
    statement.
-   Construct counterexamples to verify the falsity of a mathematical
    statement in particular contexts.

**1.5.2.1 What Is a Truth Table?** <span id="1.5.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Koehler reading assigned below
sub-subunit  1.5.2.  Make sure to review the “Logical Operations and
Truth Tables” section for an introduction that helps define truth
tables.*

**1.5.2.2 The Boolean Algebra of Propositions** <span
id="1.5.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Koehler reading assigned below
sub-subunit 1.5.2.  Make sure to review the section on “Boolean
Algebra.”*

**1.5.2.3 Tautologies, Contingencies, and Contradictions** <span
id="1.5.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Koehler reading assigned below
sub-subunit 1.5.2.  Make sure to read the definitions of tautology and
contradictions (terms highlighted in bold) in the opening paragraphs of
the “Logical Operations and Truth Tables” section.  Please note that a
contingency is simply a proposition that is caught between tautology (at
the top) and contradiction (at the bottom).  In other words, it is a
proposition which is true for some values of its components and false
for others.  For example “if it rains today, it will snow tomorrow” is a
contingency, because it can be true or false depending on the truth
values of the two component propositions. *

**1.5.2.4 Logical Equivalence** <span id="1.5.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the Koehler reading assigned below
sub-subunit 1.5.2.  In particular, focus on the text after the heading
“Equivalence” toward the end of the “Logical Operations and Truth
Tables” section.*

propositions as we have seen already in the course. *
