**Unit 5: Mathematical Induction** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will prove propositions about an infinite set of
positive integers.  Mathematical induction is a technique used to
formulate all such proofs.  The term recursion refers to a method of
defining sequences of numbers, functions, and other objects.  The term
mathematical induction refers to a method of proving properties of such
recursively defined objects.*

    Definition” and “Recursive Definition of Function”**
    Link: Old Dominion University: Shunichi Toida’s [“Recursive
    Definition”](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~toida/nerzic/content/recursive_def/rec_def.html)
    (HTML and Java) and [“Recursive Definition of
    Function”](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~toida/nerzic/content/recursive_def/rec_def.html#RecFunc)
    (HTML and Java)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the links above and read both
    essays.  Notice the similarities between using recursion to define
    sets and using recursion to define functions.  Then answer the four
    questions at the end of the first essay.  
      
     In this type of definition, first a collection of elements to be
    included initially in the set is specified.  These elements can be
    viewed as the seeds of the set being defined.  Next, the rules to be
    used to generate elements of the set from elements already known to
    be in the set (initially the seeds) are given.  These rules provide
    a method to construct the set, element by element, starting with the
    seeds.  These rules can also be used to test elements for the
    membership in the set.  
      
     Reading these essays, taking notes, and completing the assignment
    should take about 2 hours.
