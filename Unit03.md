**Unit 3: Introduction to Number Theory** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit is primarily concerned with the set of natural numbers*
***N*** *= {0****,*** *1****,*** *2****,*** *3****, . . .****}.  The
axiomatic approach to* ***N*** *will be postponed until the unit on
recursion and mathematical induction.  This unit will help you
understand the multiplication and additive structure of* ***N****.  This
unit begins with integer representation: place value.  This fundamental
idea enables you to completely understand the algorithms we learned in
elementary school for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division of multi-digit integers.  The beautiful idea in the Fusing Dots
paper will enable you to develop a much deeper understanding of the
representation of integers and other real numbers.  Then, you will learn
about the multiplicative building blocks, the prime numbers.  The
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that every positive integer
greater than 1 is a prime number or can be written as a product of prime
numbers in essentially one way.  The Division Algorithm enables you to
associate with each ordered pair of non-zero integers – a unique pair of
integers – the quotient and the remainder.  Another important topic is
modular arithmetic.  This arithmetic comes from an understanding of how
remainders combine with one another under the operations of addition and
multiplication.  Finally, the unit discusses the Euclidean Algorithm,
which provides a method for solving certain equations over the integers.
 Such equations with integer solutions are sometimes called Diophantine
Equations.*

    “Fusing Dots,” paying special attention to the exercises at the end.
     Please note that this reading covers all of the subunits assigned
    below subunit 3.1.  You may find the second half of this reading
    very difficult.  Try to read through Laurie Jarvis’ “Understanding
    Place Value” first (sub-subunit 3.1.12) and then come back to this
    more challenging paper.  You can access the solutions for selected
    problems

    Don’t worry about understanding all of the details your first time
    through the reading.  Instead, concentrate on the material in the
    first five sections of the document, and then attempt to generally
    understand the subsequent sections on Fusing Dots.  The supporting
    details will become more familiar as you work through the various
    subunits.  
      
     Reading this essay should take approximately 2 hours, and
    completing the exercises should take approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and try to solve the
    problem before checking the solution.  This problem asks: what is
    the units’ digit of the 2012<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number?  See if
    you can work this using your understanding that remainders work
    perfectly with respect to addition.  After you have attempted this
    problem, review the solution on this webpage.  
      
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: By now, the following type of problem should be
    familiar: what is the units’ digit of the expression 7^2012 X
    13^2011?  See if you can work this using your understanding that
    remainders work perfectly with respect to multiplication.  In other
    words, if you know the remainder when N is divided by d, then you
    can find the remainder when N^3 is divided by d.  
      
     The solution to this question is mentioned below, but please only
    check it after you have attempted the problem.  After you have
    completed this problem, click on the link above, and work to solve
    the problem on this webpage.  After you have attempted the problem,
    click on the link to see the solution.  
      
     Solution: The solution to the initial problem mentioned above is
    that the remainder when N^3 is divided by d is the same as when the
    r^3 is divided by d, where r is the remainder when N is divided by
    d.
